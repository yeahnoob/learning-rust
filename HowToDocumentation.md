# Documentation

`rustdoc`
`cargo doc`

Documentation can be generated in two ways: from source code, and from standalone Markdown files.

## Documenting from source code
 - The primary way.
 - Annotating the source code using `/// ... ...`
 - Documentation comments apply to the thing after them, and there Should be Some Source Code Lines After them.
 - Support Markdown Language

## Documenting from a Markdown file
```
% The title

... ... documentation ... ...

```
This `%` line Should be the First Line of the file.
